    <!-- Concerns I have:
    - I add to manually adjust the position of the cards covering the .attractions. Is there another way to do this so that I wouldn't need to manually adjust each time a change is made?
    - What would be ways to make this webpage look more modern and clean.
    - Are the element names that I used, appropriate? If not, what would be some standard naming conventions I can follow for web dev
    - I realize that as I change the size of the webpage, the layout doesn't stay as I want it to but I'm not sure how to change it so it looks okay for each size change. What would I implement here to fix that?
    - Also since i'm adjusting the position of the cards covering the attractions, if I don't set the height of the activity section then the whole activity portion becomes very long in height. So every time I make a change in card height I need to also adjust the activity section's height. 
    - Also was wondering if I was using class and id properly  -->
